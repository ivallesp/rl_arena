# rl_arena
Reinforcement Learning Arena, a python environment to make it easy to experiment with RL Algorithms. This repository is work in progress. I'll be adding functions and utilities as needed

## Getting started
I am planning to have some modules. 
- `gym_extensions.py` contains some functions and utilities related to the openAI gym library
- `architecture.py` contains a set of deep learning models which are intended to work as plug and play for the agents
- `rl_utils.py`contains utilities related to reinforcement learning in general, such as experience replay or epsilon greedy helpers
- `tf_utilities.py` contains helper functions for tensorflow

## Contribution
The library is very Work In Progress, I encourage you to correct the code if needed and add your own utilities so that we compile a good set of functions.
